# 🧠 CLAM Inference Pipeline for WSIs – Dockerized

This Docker container executes a full inference pipeline using an ensemble of 5 cross-validated CLAM models for the classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs), following the methodology described by Kalimuthu et al.

The pipeline performs the following steps automatically:

1. Patch Extraction: Generates image patches from input WSIs.

2. Feature Extraction: Extracts high-dimensional features from these patches using a Vision Transformer (UNI model).

3. Ensemble Inference: Performs slide-level classification using an ensemble of 5 pre-trained CLAM models. The final prediction is determined by majority voting across the individual models, each applying its own optimal Youden's Index threshold.

## 🚀 Running the Docker Container

To run the container, you must:

1. Create two folders on your local machine:
    - **Input folder**: Local directory with the WSIs (in `.svs`, `.tif`, `.tiff` format)
    - **Output folder**: Directory where all intermediate and final results will be saved

2. Provide the `--patch_level` parameter at runtime:
    - **Patch level** (`--patch_level`): The OpenSlide pyramid level used to extract patches (default is `1`, usually corresponds to 20x)

### 🧾 Required Parameters

| Parameter     | Description                                                                            |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-v /path/to/input:/app/input`  | Maps your local WSI folder to the container’s `/app/input` folder    |
| `-v /path/to/output:/app/output`| Maps your local results folder to `/app/output` inside the container |
| `--patch_level` | Level of downsampling (OpenSlide level)                             |

### ✅ `--patch_level` Parameter

This parameter defines the resolution level of the WSI to use when extracting patches. It corresponds to the pyramid levels generated by OpenSlide.

- `0`: Maximum resolution (typically 40x).
- `1`: 2x downsampled (typically 20x) → **default and recommended**.

> Use `--patch_level 1` unless you're certain your images require a different scale.

### Example Inference Command

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/local/input:/app/input \
  -v /path/to/local/output:/app/output \
  kalimuthu_infer_image \
  --patch_level 1
```

> 🖼️ kalimuthu_infer_image is the name of the Docker image.

> 🔁 The --patch_level parameter is optional. If not specified, it will default to 1.


### 🧑‍💻 Running Docker Without Root Permissions (Recommended)

By default, Docker containers run as the `root` user. This means that any files created inside the container may be owned by `root` on your local machine, potentially causing **permission issues** when trying to edit or delete them later.

To avoid this, you can run the container as your **local user** using the `--user` option:

```bash
--user $(id -u):$(id -g)
```

- `$(id -u)` returns your user ID (UID)
- `$(id -g)` returns your group ID (GID)

This tells Docker to run the container using your local UID and GID, ensuring that any files generated (like logs, CSVs, features) are accessible and editable by your user.

#### Example: Run with Correct User Permissions

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  -v /path/to/local/input:/app/input \
  -v /path/to/local/output:/app/output \
  kalimuthu_infer_image \
  --patch_level 1
```

This ensures that all files written to /app/output inside the container are automatically owned by the user executing the command on the host machine.

> ⚠️ Note: This method is especially important when sharing files between the container and your host machine, as it avoids `Permission Denied` errors when editing output files after the container finishes.

## 📁 Output Folder Structure

After running, the output directory will contain:

```
output/
├── patches/
│   ├── patches/       # Extracted image patches
│   ├── masks/         # Tissue masks
│   └── stitches/      # Optional tissue visualizations
├── features/          # Extracted feature files (.pt)
    ├── h5_files/      # Contains the HDF5 files with patch metadata (location, size, etc.)
    └── pt_files/      # Extracted feature tensors (.pt) used for model inference
├── process_slides.csv # CSV with processed slide IDs
├── inference_summary_predictions.csv # Final slide-level predictions
└── inference_detailed_predictions.csv # Slide-level predictions of each model
```

### 📄 Description of Output Files

- **`inference_summary_predictions.csv`**  
  Contains the final classification results for each slide. It includes the following columns:

  | Column                     | Description                                      |
  |----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | `slide_id`                 | ID of the processed slide                        |
  | `predicted_class`          | Predicted class label (0 or 1) resulting of majority voting  |

- **`inference_detailed_predictions.csv`**  
  Contains the detailed classification results for each slide. It includes the following columns:

  | Column                     | Description                                      |
  |----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
  | `slide_id`                 | ID of the processed slide                        |
  | `Model_X_Predicted_Probability_Class_1` | Predicted probability of the slide belonging to class 1, as determined by a specific cross-validation model (Model X) |
  | `Model_X_Optimal_Threshold` | Optimal Youden's Index threshold used by a specific cross-validation model (Model X) to make its binary prediction |
  | `Model_X_Individual_Binary_Prediction` | Prediction (0 or 1) made by a specific cross-validation model (Model X) for the slide, based on its predicted probability and optimal threshold |
  
  
- **`process_slides.csv`**  
  Keeps track of which slides have already been processed, to avoid repeating patch extraction and feature computation.

  - ✅ If you add a new image, it will be appended to this file and processed as expected.
  - ⚠️ If you want to **re-run the full pipeline** (patch extraction + feature extraction + inference) on a slide that’s already in the file, you **must manually delete that row** from `process_slides.csv`.

## ⚙️ GPU vs CPU Execution

This container runs with **GPU if available** and **falls back to CPU automatically** if not.

### 🧠 Note on Performance

- **GPU recommended** for fast feature extraction with Vision Transformer
- **CPU works**, but feature extraction will be significantly slower

### 🛠️ Requirements for GPU Execution

To run with GPU, your local machine must have:

- A compatible **NVIDIA GPU**
- **NVIDIA drivers** installed
- **Docker Engine** installed
- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** installed

### Installing NVIDIA Container Toolkit

**Follow the official installation guide** from NVIDIA to install and configure the container toolkit:

https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html

This includes:

- Adding the official NVIDIA repository
- Installing `nvidia-container-toolkit`
- Configuring Docker to use the `nvidia` runtime

> ⚠️ Without this, the container will **not be able to access the GPU**, even if one is present.

### Verify GPU Access from Docker

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-base nvidia-smi
```

If this command returns information about your GPU (model, memory, driver version, etc.), the system is correctly set up to use the GPU

> The inference script will automatically detect and use the GPU if available

## 🧪 Minimal Example

### 1. Create local folders:

```bash
mkdir input output
```

### 2. Copy your WSI slides (e.g. `.svs`) into `input/`.

```bash
cp your_slide.svs input/
```

### 3. Run the container:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/local/input:/app/input \
  -v /path/to/local/output:/app/output \
  kalimuthu_infer_image \
  --patch_level 1
```

### 4. View results in `output/inference_summary_predictions.csv`:

```bash
cat output/inference_summary_predictions.csv
```

## 📬 Questions?

If you encounter any problems, please check:

- That your input slides are supported (`.svs`, `.tif`, etc.)
- That Docker has the right permissions to access input/output folders
- That your system has enough RAM/VRAM for patching and feature extraction
